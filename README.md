King James Programming fortunes
===============================

fortune file with quotes from http://kingjamesprogramming.tumblr.com

The posts are generated by a Markov chain trained on the King James Bible,
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, and some of Eric S.

Fortune files are for use in the unix program `fortune` which displays
random quotes from a selection. The provided `.dat` files are not guaranteed
to work on your system. You can generate your own `.dat` files with the
command `strfile`.

The quotes in `kjp_reject` are from the list of rejected quotations and are
less safe for work than the ones in `kjp`. Remember that you can move
fortune files into the `off` directory to mark them as offensive. This will
only show them if you explicitly ask for such quotes.
